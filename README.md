# Dotfiles-Go

To supplement my dotfiles, I have a few larger Go apps to automate a few things.

## forward-file

This application allows me to forward any email file on my machine to someone
via the command-line. I don't actually do this very often, but it was a nice way
to test the forwarding feature of label-mail.

## label-mail

This is my email filtering system. I could use procmail like a normal person,
but I like being able to automate the filtering of mail in any mailbox, not just
the inbox, which allows me to setup personal data retention rules and the like.
